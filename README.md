# Data-Driven-Decision-Support-for-Aircraft-Procurement
The repository is for a Data-Driven decision support project for a new entrant company to the commercial aviation industry. It analyzes a dataset compiled by the National Transportation Safety board on aircraft accidents and incidents for the past 7 decades. Recommendations on the safest, practical, and logistically viable aircraft model and make for various aviation services the company can venture into to diversify its portfolio are backed up by descriptive statistics and justified by interactive visualizations.
